                        <strong>Alexei:</strong> It is not that only he is bad, this government is. It could have made some better choices the last couple of years. The most obvious one being the war with Japan!<br><br>

                        <strong>Igor:</strong>Well to start with, not start a war!<br><br>
                        <strong>Alexei:</strong>Yes, but what he <i>means</i> is, the Tsar has made some bad choices, but he <i>is still our Tsar.</i> You can't argue with that.
