                    When Terrako activated, he played what's known as the AoC main theme but may have a deeper meaning within the lore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Battle of Hyrule Field, Link found Terrako and the <em>small knight</em> decided to follow him.

                <p>
                    When Terrako traveled a couple of weeks into the past, some malice from a nearby guardian followed him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The malice then infected Terrako from the past creating Harbinger Ganon who then found Astor and became a big part in reviving the Calamity.

                    <h2>King Rhoam</h2>
                </header>
                <code>
                    &#9835;

                </code>
                <p>
                    In the long run, if King Rhoam didn't confiscate Terrako when Zelda was young, there wouldn't have been a timline split at all, since it was when Terrako was reactivated that he went back in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is both good and bad because if Terrako stayed activated, he could have helped in the fight against the calamity and Ganon would have never gone back in time, but it is good because it created a timeline split where there was no 100 year apocalypse.

                <p>
                    Not much is known about Zelda's Mother but she did help create Terrako so she <strong>is</strong> pretty important
                </p>
                <p>
                    She also programmed Terrako to protect Zelda which is <em>why</em> he went back in time.

                <p>
                    Zelda's Sealing power may not seem so important, but it is for one very big reason, can you guess?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zelda's Sealing Power both took out the guardians at Fort Hateno but also awakend / reactivated Terrako!
