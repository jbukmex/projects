                    <h3>Skyward Sword, Era of the Sky, 2011</h3>
                    <p>Skward Sword is a very big landmark for the Zelda series because it is the closest game so far to the story of creation. Demise, an evil being is revived by his minion Ghirahim. Demise plans to take over the world which would have been fully within his power. However, a teenage boy caled Link who was training to become a knight stood before Demise saying that he would stop him. Shocked by Link as he was the first human to think about denying Demise, he humours Link and decides allow a dual to commence. Demise loses at the end of the game stating a curse: "Extraordinary. You stand as a paragon of your kind, human. You fight like no human or demon I have ever known. Though this is not the end. My hate... never perishes. It is born anew in a cycle with no end! I will rise again. Those like you... Those who share the blood of the goddess and the spirit of the hero... They are eternally bound to this curse. An incarnation of my hatred shall ever follow your kind, dooming them to wander a blood-soaked sea of darkness for all time!" This curse incarnated into all of the main enmies in all Zelda Games to come.</p>
                    <h3>The Minish Cap, Era of Prosperity, 2004</h3>
                    <h3>Four Swords, Era of the Four Sword, 2004</h3>
                    <h3>Ocarina of Time, Era of Time, 1998</h3>
                    <p>This was another big landmark for the Legend of Zelda as it made the first Timeline Split. The game had three endings all leading to differant timelines. One is the Downfall timeline where Ganondof Dragmire beats Link and continues his rampage. Another is the Child timeline where Link beats Ganon and goes back in time to being a kid, and the last is the adult timeline where Link once again beats Ganon but stays an adult and continues with what he's doing.</p>
