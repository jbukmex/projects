                        It's thursday 25th February 2021 and the first Nintendo Direct since September 2019 was a week ago. We recieved no new information related to the sequal to <em>'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.'</em> We did recieve news that <em>'The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'</em> is set to release on July 16th, which - of course - is great news.
                        <br>
                        Hopes were high for the Zelda 35th Anniversary last Sunday, but once again, no news. We've had no news whatsoever - besides that fact that there is no news - related to the sequal trailer in June 2019.
                    </p>

                        The video above is seriously the only thing that we've had for nearly two years! I know, it's <strong>only</strong> been nearly two years, but it's still annoying that we haven't had any comments from nintendo, beside something along the lines of "<u>We can't give any news related to the sequel of Breath of the Wild, but please be patient, news is coming this year.</u>"
                        <br>
                        I don't want to sound impatient, but a line like: "The sequel to Breath of the Wild is <strong>still</strong> in production" would be satisfactory.
                        <br>
                        Anyway, on a brighter note, we have some dates to look forward to for <em>some</em> possible news.

                        <ul id="entry1-content">
                            <li><strong>Wednesday 3rd March 2021</strong> - This, I think is one of the most likely dates, is the mark of the four year anniversary of Breath of the Wild. I honestly can't wait, and I do think that Nintendo will release something. Hopefully.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wednesday 31st March 2021</strong> - This is the end of the time limit to purchase the <em>Mario 3D All Stars</em> Game from Mario's 35th Anniversary. This could mean some news related BotW 2 since Mario's time would be over, and Zelda's would start, but Pokemon's 25th Anniversary is this year as well, so it's unknown.</li>
                            <li><strong>Friday July 16th 2021</strong> - Finally, This is the day <em>Skyward Sword</em> and the <em>Zelda Joy-cons</em> are released, to go with the occasion, it's possible that Nintendo will release some Botw 2 news.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p id="entry1-content">
                        Anyway, I think that's all I have to say, hope you enjoyed some usesless opinion and some useful dates, goodbye!
